# JavaScript scripts - so far untested 

* using es6 and babel this will be some scripts for my personal website
* will create all tests in jasmine 2 with karma and babel 
* will use nodejs to render server side data 
* may use handlebars as templating or simple strings TBD

### Flow
* write modules in es6 in src
* run npm run build
* build creates a work directory with babel preprocessed files
* build creates js directory with webpack file
* currently tests need to be written in common js :( 
* npm run tests runs all the tests
* npm run clear removes work and js directories
